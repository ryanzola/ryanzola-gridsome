    <Layout data-server-rendered="true" id="app"><h1>New Flex Box Guides on MDN</h1><!----><div><p><strong>CSS Flexible Box Layout</strong> is a module of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.</p>
<p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.</p>
<hr />
<p>When we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional, we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time &#8211; either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Two Axes of Flexbox</h3>
<p>The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 60px;">row</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px;">row-reverse</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px;">column</li>
<li style="padding-left: 60px;">column-reverse</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you choose <strong>row</strong> or <strong>row-reverse</strong>, your main axis will run along the row in the <strong>inline direction</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15614/Basics1.png" /></p>
<p>Choose <strong>column</strong> or <strong>column-reverse</strong> and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom &#8211; in the <strong>block direction</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15615/Basics2.png" /></p>
<h5>The cross axis</h5>
<p>The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your <strong>flex-direction</strong> (main axis) is set to <strong>row</strong> or <strong>row-reverse</strong> the cross axis runs down the columns.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15616/Basics3.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If your main axis is <strong>column</strong> or <strong>column-reverse</strong> then the cross axis runs along the rows.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15617/Basics4.png" /></p>
<p>Understanding which axis is which is important when we start to look at aligning and justifying flex items; flexbox features properties that align and justify content along one axis or the other.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Start and End Lines</h3>
<p>Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox <strong>makes no assumptions</strong> about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document and run towards the right hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.</p>
<p>If the <strong>flex-direction </strong>is <strong>row</strong> and I am working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15618/Basics5.png" /></p>
<p>If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of the main axis would be on the right and the end edge would be on the left.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15619/Basics6.png" /></p>
<p>In both cases the start edge of the cross axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.</p>
<p>After a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural, and will be useful to know when dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same patterns.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Flex Container</h3>
<p>An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a <strong>flex container</strong>. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area&#8217;s container&#8217;s <strong>display</strong> property to <strong>flex</strong> or <strong>inline-flex</strong>. As soon as we do this, the direct children of that container become <strong>flex items</strong>. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Items display in a row (the <strong>flex-direction</strong> property&#8217;s default is <strong>row</strong>).</li>
<li>The items start from start edge of the main axis.</li>
<li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li>
<li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
<li>The <strong>flex-basis</strong> property is set to <strong>auto</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>flex-wrap</strong> property is set to <strong>nowrap</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.</p>
<h3>Changing flex-direction</h3>
<p>Adding the <strong>flex-direction</strong> property to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting <strong>flex-direction: row-reverse</strong> will keep the items displaying along the row, however, the start and end lines are switched.</p>
<p>If we change the <strong>flex-direction</strong> to <strong>column</strong> the main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set <strong>column-reverse</strong> and end lines are again switched.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Multi-line Flex Containers with flex-wrap</h3>
<p>While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause our flex items to wrap into multiple lines. In doing so, you should consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will happen across that line, without reference to the lines either side.</p>
<p>To cause wrapping behavior, add the property <strong>flex-wrap</strong> with a value of <strong>wrap</strong>. Now, should your items be too large to display in one line, they will wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items that have been given a width, the total width of the items being too wide for the flex container. As <strong>flex-wrap</strong> is set to <strong>wrap</strong>, the items wrap. Set it to <strong>nowrap</strong>, which is also the initial value, and they will instead shrink to fit the container because they are using initial flexbox values that allows items to shrink. Using <strong>nowrap</strong> would cause an overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.</p>

<h3>The flex-flow Shorthand</h3>
<p>You can combine the two properties <strong>flex-direction</strong> and <strong>flex-wrap</strong> the into <strong>flex-flow</strong> shorthand. The first value specified is <strong>flex-direction</strong> and the second value is <strong>flex-wrap</strong>.</p>
<pre>.box {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;</pre>
<pre>&lt;div class="box"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<hr />
<h3>Properties Applied to Flex Items</h3>
<p>To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We do this by way of three properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>flex-grow</li>
<li>flex-shrink</li>
<li>flex-basis</li>
</ul>
<p>We will take a brief look at these properties in this overview, and you can gain a fuller understanding in the guide <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Controlling_Ratios_of_Flex_Items_Along_the_Main_Ax">Controlling Ratios of Flex Items on the Main Axis</a>.</p>
<p>Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of <strong>available space</strong>. What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at align items.</p>
<p>If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don&#8217;t change the initial values, then flexbox will put that space after the last item. <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15620/Basics7.png" /></p>
<p>If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between the items. This is what the <strong>flex</strong> properties that we apply to the items themselves will do.</p>
<h5>The flex-basis property</h5>
<p>The <strong>flex-basis </strong>is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial value is <strong>auto</strong> &#8211; in this case, the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the flex-basis.</p>
<p>If the items don&#8217;t have a size, then the content&#8217;s size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare <strong>display: flex</strong> on the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.</p>
<h5>the flex-grow property</h5>
<p>With the <strong>flex-grow</strong> property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main axis from their <strong>flex-basis</strong>. This will cause the item to stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or a portion of the available space if other items are allowed to grow too.</p>
<p>If we gave all of our items in the example above a <strong>flex-grow</strong> value of 1,100 px then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.</p>
<p>The <strong>flex-grow</strong> property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a <strong>flex-grow</strong> value of 2 and the other items a value of 1, 2 parts will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).</p>
<h5>the flex-shrink property</h5>
<p>Where the <strong>flex-grow</strong>  property deals with adding space in the main axis, the <strong>flex-shrink</strong> property controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items and <strong>flex-shrink</strong> is set to a positive integer, the item can become smaller than the flex-basis. As with <strong>flex-grow</strong>, different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others &#8211; an item with a higher value set for <strong>flex-shrink</strong> will shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.</p>
<p>The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that <strong>flex-shrink</strong> has the potential to appear less consistent than <strong>flex-grow</strong> in behavior.</p>
<pre>Note that these values for flex-grow and flex-shrink are proportions. Typically, if we had all of our items set to flex: 1 1 200px and then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to flex: 2 1 200px. However you could use flex: 10 1 200px and flex: 20 1 200px if you wanted.</pre>
<h5>shorthand values for flex properties</h5>
<p>You will very rarely see <strong>flex-grow</strong>, <strong>flex-shrink</strong>, and <strong>flex-basis</strong> properties used individually; instead, they are combined into the <strong>flex</strong> shorthand. The <strong>flex</strong> shorthand allows you to set three values in this order &#8211; <strong>flex-grow</strong>, <strong>flex-shrink</strong>, <strong>flex-basis</strong>.</p>
<p>The live example allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value is <strong>flex-grow</strong>. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is <strong>flex-shrink</strong> &#8211; with a positive value the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is <strong>flex-basis</strong>; this is the value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.</p>
<p>There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are as follows:</p>
<pre>flex: initial
flex: auto
flex: none
flex: &lt;positive-number&gt;</pre>
<p>Setting <strong>flex: initial </strong>resets the item to the initial values of Flexbox. This is the same as <strong>flex: 0 1 auto</strong>. In this case, the value of <strong>flex-grow</strong> is 0, so the items will not grow larger than their <strong>flex-basis</strong> size. The value of <strong>flex-shrink</strong> is 1, so items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The value of <strong>flex-basis</strong> is <strong>auto</strong>. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension, or they will get their size from the content size.</p>
<p>Using <strong>flex: auto</strong> is the same as using <strong>flex: 1 1 auto</strong>; everything is as with <strong>flex: initial</strong> but in this case, the items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink if required.</p>
<p>Using <strong>flex:  none</strong> will create a fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote <strong>flex: 0 0 auto</strong>. The items cannot grow or shrink but will be laid out using flexbox with a <strong>flex-basis</strong> of <strong>auto</strong>.</p>
<p>The shorthand you often see in tutorials is <strong>flex: 1</strong> or <strong>flex: 2</strong> and so on. This is as if you used <strong>flex: 1 1 0</strong>. The items can grow and shrink from a <strong>flex-basis</strong> of 0.</p>
<h3>Alignment, Justification, and Distribution of Free Space Between Items</h3>
<p>A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex items.</p>
<h5>align-items</h5>
<p>The <strong>align-items</strong> property will align the items on the cross axis.</p>
<p>The initial value for this property is <strong>stretch</strong> and this is why flex items stretch to the height of the tallest one by default. They are in fact stretching to fill the flex container &#8211; the tallest item is defining the height of that.</p>
<p>You could instead set <strong>align-items </strong> to <strong>flex-start</strong> in order to make the items line up at the start of the flex container, <strong>flex-end</strong> to align them to the end, or <strong>center</strong> to align them in the center. Try this in the live example &#8211; I have given the flex container a height in order that you can see how the items can be moved around inside the container. See what happens if you set the value of <strong>align-items</strong> to:</p>
<pre>align-items: stretch
align-items: flex-start
align-items: flex-end
align-items: center</pre>
<h5>justify-content</h5>
<p>The <strong>justify-content</strong> property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which <strong>flex-direction</strong> has set the flow. The initial value is <strong>flex-start</strong> which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to <strong>flex-end</strong> to line them up at the end, or <strong>center</strong> to line them up in the center.</p>
<p>You can also use the value <strong>space-between</strong> to take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each of them. Or, to cause an equal amount of space on the right and left of each item use the value <strong>space-around</strong> or <strong>space-evenly</strong>.</p>
<p>Try the following values of <strong>justify-content</strong> in the live example:</p>
<pre>justify-content: stretch;
justify-content: flex-start;
justify-content: flex-end;
justify-content: center;
justify-content: space-around;
justify-content: space-between;</pre>

As soon as we do this, the direct children of that container become \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex items\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.

Any space distribution will happen across that line, without reference to the lines either side.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo cause wrapping behavior, add the property \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-wrap\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E with a value of \u003Cstrong\u003Ewrap\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Now, should your items be too large to display in one line, they will wrap onto another line.

Using \u003Cstrong\u003Enowrap\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E would cause an overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class='codepen'  data-height='265' data-theme-id='dark' data-slug-hash='eyLpBz' data-default-tab='css,result' data-animations='run' data-editable='true' data-embed-version='2'\u003E\nSee the Pen \u003Ca href=’https:\u002F\u002Fcodepen.io\u002Fryanzola\u002Fpen\u002FeyLpBz\u002F’\u003Eflex-wrap Example\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Ryan Zola (\u003Ca href=’https:\u002F\u002Fcodepen.io\u002Fryanzola’\u003E@ryanzola\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) on \u003Ca href=’https:\u002F\u002Fcodepen.io’\u003ECodePen\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.dark\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cscript async src=\"\u002F\u002Fcodepen.io\u002Fassets\u002Fembed\u002Fei.js\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fscript\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe flex-flow Shorthand\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can combine the two properties \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-direction\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-wrap\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E the into \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-flow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E shorthand.

What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at align items.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don&#8217;t change the initial values, then flexbox will put that space after the last item. \u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmdn.mozillademos.org\u002Ffiles\u002F15620\u002FBasics7.png\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between the items. This is what the \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E properties that we apply to the items themselves will do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EThe flex-basis property\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eis what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial value is \u003Cstrong\u003Eauto\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8211; in this case, the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the flex-basis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the items don&#8217;t have a size, then the content&#8217;s size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare \u003Cstrong\u003Edisplay: flex\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E on the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003Ethe flex-grow property\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main axis from their \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. This will cause the item to stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or a portion of the available space if other items are allowed to grow too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we gave all of our items in the example above a \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E value of 1,100 px then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E value of 2 and the other items a value of 1, 2 parts will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003Ethe flex-shrink property\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere the \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E  property deals with adding space in the main axis, the \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E property controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items and \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is set to a positive integer, the item can become smaller than the flex-basis. As with \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others &#8211; an item with a higher value set for \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E will shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E has the potential to appear less consistent than \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E in behavior.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003ENote that these values for flex-grow and flex-shrink are proportions. Typically, if we had all of our items set to flex: 1 1 200px and then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to flex: 2 1 200px. However you could use flex: 10 1 200px and flex: 20 1 200px if you wanted.\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003Eshorthand values for flex properties\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will very rarely see \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E properties used individually; instead, they are combined into the \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E shorthand. The \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E shorthand allows you to set three values in this order &#8211; \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe live example allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value is \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8211; with a positive value the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E; this is the value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases.

This is the same as \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex: 0 1 auto\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. In this case, the value of \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-grow\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is 0, so the items will not grow larger than their \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E size. The value of \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-shrink\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is 1, so items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The value of \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-basis\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is \u003Cstrong\u003Eauto\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.

See what happens if you set the value of \u003Cstrong\u003Ealign-items\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003Ealign-items: stretch\r\nalign-items: flex-start\r\nalign-items: flex-end\r\nalign-items: center\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003Ejustify-content\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Ejustify-content\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-direction\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E has set the flow. The initial value is \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-start\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to \u003Cstrong\u003Eflex-end\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to line them up at the end, or \u003Cstrong\u003Ecenter\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to line them up in the center.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use the value \u003Cstrong\u003Espace-between\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each of them. Or, to cause an equal amount of space on the right and left of each item use the value \u003Cstrong\u003Espace-around\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003Espace-evenly\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the following values of \u003Cstrong\u003Ejustify-content\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E in the live example:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003Ejustify-content: stretch;\r\njustify-content: flex-start;\r\njustify-content: flex-end;\r\njustify-content: center;\r\njustify-content: space-around;\r\njustify-content: space-between;\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n","featuredMedia":null,"categories":[{"id":"4","title":"CSS","path":"\u002Fcategory\u002Fcss\u002F"}],"tags":[]}},"context":{}};(function(){var s;(s=document.currentScript||document.scripts[document.scripts.length-1]).parentNode.removeChild(s);}());</script><script src="/assets/js/app.004580f9.js" defer></script><script src="/assets/js/page--src--templates--word-press-post-vue.8ec46e40.js" defer></script>
